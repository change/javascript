# Change.org JavaScript Style Guide

We use the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](airbnb/javascript) as a foundation for our own JavaScript
code style recommendations.

This repo includes some npm [packages](packages/) that encapsulate a couple of different flavours of
eslint configs, which themselves inherit from `eslint-config-airbnb*` but also bring in a handful of
other relevant plugins and overrides.
